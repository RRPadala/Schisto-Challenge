This is a preliminary analysis of a pilot project comparing the response to schistosomiasis between humans and macaques. 
Based on experimental work by Murilo et. al. (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-26497-0) showing that macaques can self-cure from infection.

This pilot study was to determine the feasibility of further analysis of a larger set of samples. On December 2024, the pilot study was judged a success and a larger study will follow in February 2025. 
I have finished my internship and am no longer a part of the laboratory but this repo contains my code used in the pilot study. This work was performed as the second part of my second Master's internship under Dr. Ahmed Mahfouz and Mikhael Manurung.
